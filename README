README for the final game framework
-----------------------------------

The goal of this framework is to integrate the work of all programming
teams into our game "enigma3d". To make this possible, this framework
provides the entire "infrastructure" of the game, so that each team
has their own set of files they work on.

 * Below is the list of current programming teams, each team has a
   label TXX (for some number XX). The files belonging to such a group are
   TXX.cpp and TXX.h. 

 * YOU MUST NOT change any other files than the ones belonging to your
   group, because otherwise the integration of the works is not
   possible. 

 * If any team has a problem integrating their work into the game by
   changing only their TXX.cpp/.h, they MUST contact us; then we will
   find a solution, in the worst case with that team's work not being
   integrated with the rest.

 * Please do look carefully through all the central files of the program and 
   their comments to understand how the game works:
   - game.cpp / game.h
   - field.cpp / field.h 
   - main.cpp
   and most importantly the example fields in
   - testfield.cpp / testfield.h
   These latter two are very much like how your TXX.cpp/TXX.h should
   look like. You are welcome to copy any of the code from these existing 
   files and re-use it in your TXX.cpp/TXX.h. 

 * You see in the code, that the name of the class that team TXX would
   build is TXX, and the unique identifier for that Field is tTXX that
   should return upon getFieldIdentifier(). You must not change that.

 * Every group should write a level file (modifying
   enigma3d.app/Contents/Resources/field.lvl) in which the own kind of
   Field occurs. The field entry in the level file should simply be
   the group number XX.
   
 * FINAL SUBMISSION: send to Jose <jncq@imm.dtu.dk> :
   - your TXX.h 
   - your TXX.cpp 
   - your field.lvl -- renamed to TXX.lvl
   - any textures/etc. your stone uses

 * If your team works on more than one Field type, ask Jose for reserving
   additional names/identifiers for you. 

 * MOST IMPORTANT: Any problems, unclarities, questions : contact us!!
